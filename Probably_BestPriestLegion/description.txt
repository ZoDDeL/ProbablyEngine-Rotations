BestPriestLegion 7.1.5
----------------------


1.
Discipline:
was the original prototype for the other rotations.

STRONG at:
Survivability
Healing/Shielding while moving
SingleTarget Damage output (for a Heal)
PVP (as long you have mana)
5-Man Dungeons
Solo-ing Group Quests
Solo-ing Dungeonbosses while the rest of the party fails...

WEAK at:
Raidheal because of high manacost (7.1.5)
AOE Damage Output(no native aoe spells in this spec...)



2.
Shadow:
made for faster questing.

STRONG at:
Slow Bossfights with minimum movement
Questing 100-110


WEAK at:
Survivablity
PVP (in my opinion its a glasscannon who needs stand still)
Quick Damage because of casttimes/channeling and dots and the insanity mechanic.
nearly zero damage output while moving.



3.
Holy:
made as an option for Raidheal

STRONG at:
Raidheal (many different usefull heals/hots from cheap efficiant to expensive high heals)


WEAK at:
Surviabilty (aside selfheal this spec just meltdown on burstDMG)
PVP (when you get focused you are dead. no fun at all in pvp)
